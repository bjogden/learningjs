# Working with JS

Wanted to create working examples demonstrating proficiency in Javascript, and I have also been interested in creating a pet age calculator. 

Used JS and simple HTML/CSS with responsive design to create calculator that determines age of house dog or cat: http://bryceogden.com/petcalc
